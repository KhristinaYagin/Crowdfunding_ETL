Learn the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process, which consists of extracting data from datasets, transforming the data, and then loading the transformed data into a database. Use Python and Pandas methods and functions and to list comprehensions to extract, transform, and clean data. Then, start working on the ETL mini project, learn how to use regular expressions to find patterns and extract data from text and string data, and youâ€™ll work on the ETL mini project. As the amount of data, data sources, and data types at organizations grow, the importance of making use of that data in analytics, data science and machine learning initiatives to derive business insights grows as well. The need to prioritize these initiatives puts increasing pressure on the data engineering teams because processing the raw, messy data into clean, fresh, reliable data is a critical step before these initiatives can be pursued. ETL, which stands for extract, transform, and load, is the process data engineers use to extract data from different sources, transform the data into a  usable and trusted resource, and load that data into the systems end-users can access and use downstream to solve business problems.
